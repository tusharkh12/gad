# GAD Course Projects

This repository contains solutions and implementations for the GAD (Algorithms and Data Structures) course. Each subfolder corresponds to a different assignment or topic:

- **gad22e01-ge42bax**: Maze solving algorithms
- **gad22e02-ge42bax**: Binary search and interval search
- **gad22e03-ge42bax**: Dynamic arrays, stacks, and queues
- **gad22e04-ge42bax**: Simple hash tables
- **gad22e05-ge42bax**: Double hashing and hashable factories
- **gad22e07-ge42bax**: Radix sort and binary bucket sort

## How to Run

Each project contains its own `src` directory with Java source files. You can compile and run them using your preferred Java IDE or the command line.

## Repository Cleanliness

This repository is configured to ignore IDE, build, and OS-specific files. Only source code and essential documentation are tracked.
